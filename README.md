All folders contain information on how to make your own dataset (from unprocessed audio file and text file) for finetuning MMS TTS.
  
When finetuning in google colab make sure to use 350 or less rows from the dataset because of GPU memory.

P.S. Folder named audio data is empty, and you need to add your long audio file in there.
