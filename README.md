Folder named Working Dataset from Mozilla contains all necessary files. In order to run finetuning you only need to specify paths.

All other folders contain information on how to make your own dataset (from unprocessed audio file and text file) for finetuning MMS TTS.
  
When finetuning in google colab make sure to use 350 or less rows from the dataset because of GPU memory.
